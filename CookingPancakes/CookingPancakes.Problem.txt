Write a program for stacks of delicious pancakes with the task

Cooking the perfect stack of pancakes on a grill is a tricky business because no matter ho
w hard you try, all pancakes in any stack have different diameters
For neatnessâ€™s sake, however, you can sort the stack by size such that each pancake is sma
ller than all the pancakes below it
The size of the pancake is given by its diameter
Write a program to help her with the task
(** Test using 3 different data sets)

Input

The input consists of a sequence of stacks of pancakes
Each stack will consist of between 1 and 30 pancakes, and each pancake will have an integ
er diameter between 1 and 10
The input is terminated by end-of-file
Each stack is given as a single line of input, with the top pancake on a stack appearing firs
t on a line, the bottom pancake appearing last, and all pancakes separated by a space

Output

For each stack of pancakes, your program should echo the original stack on one line, follo
wed by a sequence of flips that results in sorting the stack of pancakes so that the largest
pancake is on the bottom and the smallest on top
The sequence of flips for each stack should be terminated by a 0, indicating no more flips
necessary
Once a stack is sorted, no more flips should be made

Example
Input
5 1 2 3 4

Output
5 1 2 3 4 (1 2 3 4 5)
1 2 0
