A group of students are members of a club that travels annually to different
locations during the long Thanksgiving holidays. This holiday, they are
planning a trip to Jeju-do
The group agrees in advance to share expenses equally, but it is not practical
things, such as meals, hotels, taxi rides, and plane tickets
After the trip, each student‚Äôs expenses are tallied, and money is exchanged
so that the net cost to each is the same, to within 10 won. In the past, these
money exchanges have been tedious and time-consuming

Your job is to compute, from a list of expenses, the minimum amount of
money that must change hands in order to equalize (within one won) all the
students‚Äô costs

won
A single line containing 0 follows the information for the last trip

Output

For each trip, output a line stating the total amount of money, in won units, that must be
exchanged to equalize the students‚Äô costs
