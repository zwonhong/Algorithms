Some people think that the bigger an elephant is, the smarter it is

To disprove this, you want to analyze a collection of elephants and place as l
arge a subset of elephants as possible into a sequence whose weights are inc
reasing but IQ’s are decreasing

Input

The input will consist of data for a bunch of elephants, at one elephant per line
terminated by the end-of-file
The data for each particular elephant will consist of a pair of integers:
the first representing its size in kilograms and the second representing its IQ in the
hundredths of IQ points
Both integers are between 1 and 10,000
The data contains information on at most 1,000 elephants
Two elephants may have the same weight, the same IQ, or even the same weight and IQ

Output

The first output line should contain an integer 𝑛, the length of the elephant sequence
found
The remaining 𝑛 lines should each contain a single positive integer representing an
elephant
Denote the numbers on the 𝑖th data line as 𝑊[𝑖] and 𝑆[𝑖]
If these sequence of n elephants are 𝑎[1], 𝑎[2], … ,𝑎[𝑛] then it must be the case that
𝑊[𝑎[1]] < 𝑊[𝑎[2]] < ⋯ < 𝑊[𝑎[𝑛]] and 𝑆[𝑎[1]] > 𝑆[𝑎[2]] > ⋯ > 𝑆[𝑎[𝑛]]
In order for the answer to be correct, 𝑛 must be as large as possible
	All inequalities are strict: weights must be strictly increasing, and IQs must be strictly decreasing
Your program can report any correct answer for a given input

Example
Input
6008 1300
6000 2100
500 2000
1000 4000
1100 3000
6000 2000
8000 1400
6000 1200
2000 1900

Output
4 (it means n)
