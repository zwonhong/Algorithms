Susan likes to make line drawings with ink
There are several dots on the drawing paper
Your job is to tell Susan how to connect the dots to minimize the amount of ink used
Susan connects the dots by drawing straight lines between pairs, possibly lifting the pen between lines.
When Susan is done, there must be a sequence of connected lines from any dot to any other dot
Test using 3 different data sets (test cases)

Input

The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself indicating the number of dots (0<n<30) on drawing paper
For each dots, a line follows; each following line contains two real numbers indicating the (x,y) coordinates of the dots

Output

Your program must print a single real number to two decimal places:
the minimum total length of ink lines that can connect all the dots
