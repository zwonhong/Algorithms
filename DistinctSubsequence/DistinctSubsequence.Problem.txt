A subsequence of a given sequence S consists of S with sero of more elements deleted
Formally, a sequence Z = z_1z_2...z_k is a subsequence of X = x_1x_2...x_m if there exists a stritly increasing sequence < i_1i_2...i_k > of indices of X such that for all j = 1, 2, ..., k, we have x_{ij} = z_j
For example, Z = bcdb is a subsequence of X = abcbdab with corresponding index sequence <2, 3, 5, 7>
Your job is to write a program that counts the number of occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence such that each has a distinct index sequence

Input

The first line of the input contains an integer N indicating the number of test cases to
follow
The first line of each test case contains a string X, composed entirely of lowercase
alphabetic characters and having length no greater than 10,000
The second line contains another string Z having length no greater than 100 and also
composed of only lowercase alphabetic characters
Be assured that neither Z nor any prefix or suffix of Z will have more than 10100 distinct
occurrences in X as a subsequence

Output

For each test case, output the number of distinct occurrences of Z in X as a subsequence
Output for each input set must be on a separate line
