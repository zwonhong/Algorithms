Write a program to help ‘Student Y’ longest nap with the task

Students lead very busy lives with full schedules of work and appointments
Student Y likes to nap during the day, but her schedule is so busy that she doesn’t have m
any chances to do so
She really wants to take one nap every day, however
Naturally, she wants the longest nap possible, given her schedule
Write a program to help her with the task

Input

The first line of each case contains integers 𝑠 < 100, representing the number of scheduled appointments for that day
The next 𝑠 lines contain the appointments in the format (time1 time2 appointment), where time1 represents the time at which the appointment starts and time2 the time it ends
All times will be in the hh:mm format; the ending time will always be strictly after the starting time, and separated by a single space
All times will be greater than or equal to 10:00 and less than or equal to 18:00
Thus, your response must be in this interval as well
The appointment can be any sequence of characters, but will always be on the same line
You can assume that no line is longer than 255 characters, that 10<hh<18, and that 0<m<60
You cannot assume, however, that the input will be in any specific order, and must read the input until you reach the end of file

Output

For each test case, you must print the following line:
Day #d: the longest nap starts at hh:mm and will last for [H hours and] M minutes

d stands for the number of the test case (starting from 1)
hh:mm is the time when the nap can start
To display the length of the nap, follow these rules:
○ If the total time 𝑋 is less than 60 minutes, just print “𝑋 minutes”
○ If the total duration 𝑋 is at least 60 minutes, print “𝐻 hours and 𝑀 minutes”
The duration of the nap is calculated by the difference between the ending time and the
beginning time
If there is more than one longest nap with the same duration, print the earliest one

Example

Input
4
10:00 12:00 Lectures
12:00 13:00 Lunch, like always
13:00 15:00 Boring lectures
16:45 17:45 Reading (to be or not to be?)

Output
Day #1: the longest nap starts at 15:00 and will last for 1 hours and 45 minutes
