Lisa collects beautiful pearls and wants to buy jewel boxes to store them

The boxes come in two types:
Type 1: each such box costs c1 dollars and can hold exactly n1 perals
Type 2: each such box costs c2 dollars and can hold exactly n2 perals

She wants each box to be filled to its capacity and also to minimize the total cost of buying them
Help Lisa find the best way to distribute her pearls among the boxes

Input

The input file may contain multiple test cases
Each test case begins with a line containing the integer n (0<n<1000)
The second line contains c1 and the third line contains c2 and n2
Here, c1, c2, n1, and n2 are all positive integers having values smaller than 1000
A test case containing a zero for the number of pearls terminates the input

Output

To each test case in the input, print a line containing the minimum cost solution
two nonnegative integers m1 and m2, where mi = number of type i boxes required if one exists
Otherwise print “failed”
If a solution exists, you may assume that it is unique
