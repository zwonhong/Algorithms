A fashionable dressmaker has 𝑁 orders from customers which she must satisfy
The dressmaker can work on only one job in each day, and jobs usually take several days
For the 𝑖-th job, the integer 𝑇𝑖 1 ≤ 𝑇𝑖 ≤ 1,000 denotes the number of days it takes the dressmaker to finish the job
But popularity has its price
For each day of delay before starting to work on the 𝑖-th job, the dressmaker has agreed to pay a fine of 𝑆𝑖 1 ≤ 𝑆𝑖 ≤ 10,000 cents per day
Help the dressmaker by writing a program to find the sequence of jobs with a minimum total fine
Test Using 3 Different Data Sets (test cases)

Input

The input begins with a single positive integer on a line by itself, indicating the number of the test cases, followed by a blank line
There is also a blank line between two consecutive cases
The first line of each contains an integer reporting the number of jobs 𝑁, where 1 ≤ 𝑁 ≤ 1,000
The  𝑖-th subsequent line contains the completion time 𝑇𝑖 and daily penalty 𝑆𝑖 for the 𝑖-th job

Output

For each test case, your program should print the sequence of jobs with minimal fine
Each job should be represented by its position in the input
All integers should be placed on only one output line, and each pair should be separated by one space
If multiple solutions are possible, print the first one in lexicographic order
The output of two consecutive cases must be separated by a blank line
